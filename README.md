## Overview
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis using various machine learning algorithms on the provided dataset. The goal is to classify text into different sentiment categories such as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Models Used
- Decision Tree
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Bayesian Learning
- Ensemble Learning: Bagging & Boosting

## Dataset
We used the [Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhi8923shriv/sentiment-analysis-dataset) from Kaggle. The dataset contains text data labeled with sentiment categories.

## Methodology and Results
Our methodology involved the following steps:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, normalization, and text vectorization.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Experimentation with multiple machine learning algorithms and evaluation based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
- **Impact of NLTK**: Comparison of model performance with and without NLTK preprocessing.
  
## Key findings and observations:
- Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest exhibited superior performance.
- NLTK preprocessing significantly improved model efficacy.
- Distinct word patterns across sentiment categories influenced model selection and feature engineering.

## Additional Notes
- The project repository includes Jupyter Notebooks documenting code implementation and model evaluation.
- Extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand dataset characteristics and sentiment distribution.
- This project contributes to advancing natural language processing (NLP) by exploring diverse ML algorithms for sentiment analysis and emphasizing the importance of text preprocessing.
